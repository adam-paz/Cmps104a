#--------------------------------------------------------------------|

This program was completed using pair programming with members:
Noah Brown (nebrown@ucsc.edu)
Adam Paz   (apa10@ucsc edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should drive 
roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together and at most 
25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent 
working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed
by the partner. The object is to work together, learning from each 
other, not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner 
working on a different piece.

Noah Brown spent        .5 hours working alone.
Adam Paz spent          .5 hours working alone.
We spent                12 hours working together.
Noah Brown spent        6 hours driving.
Adam Paz spent          6 hours driving.
